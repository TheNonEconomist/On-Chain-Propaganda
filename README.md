# On-Chain-Propaganda

## What for?
To propagandise the on-chain world for world domination. 
Just kidding, it's really to distribute bunch of educational and fun material to on-chain users.

### Examples?
Could be educational material for on-chain security practices that could be done at the user level, could be just to send fun memes to your on-chain friends, could be anything you can imagine tbh!

## Why?
Cuz so many things could be automated in a fun and enjoyable way. If it teaches people useful things, even better!

## How does it work?
Goal is to make it pretty easy to plug-in any one of your favorite on-chain characters or pictures and turn them into a contents that actually teaches people useful things or can have fun with friends or both! 

Up to your imagination I guess!
