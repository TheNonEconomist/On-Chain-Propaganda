# On-Chain-Propaganda

## What for?
To propagandise the on-chain world for world domination. 
Just kidding, it's really to distribute bunch of educational and fun material to various on-chain community members.

### Examples?
Could be educational material for on-chain security practices for retail, could be fun memes that create engagement amongst community members, could be anything you can imagine tbh!

## Why?
Cuz so much of retail education, engagement, and community mgmt are actually boilerplate tasks that could do well from some automation. If it's fun and educational, even better.


## How does it work?
Goal is to make it pretty easy to plug-in any one of your favorite on-chain characters or pictures and turn them into contents that actually teaches people useful things or can have fun with friends or both! Should be able to be distributed to right communities based on what the most crucial missing gaps at the moment - both educationally and emotionally.

Up to your imagination I guess!
